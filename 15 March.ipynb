    "Ans1:-Artificial intelligence, commonly referred to as AI, is the process of imparting data, information, and human intelligence to machines. The main goal of Artificial Intelligence is to develop self-reliant machines that can think and act like humans. These machines can mimic human behavior and perform tasks by learning and problem-solving. Most of the AI systems simulate natural intelligence to solve complex problems.\n",

    "Machine learning is a discipline of computer science that uses computer algorithms and analytics to build predictive models that can solve business problems. \n",

    "Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that deals with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. Deep learning algorithms can work with an enormous amount of both structured and unstructured data. Deep learning’s core concept lies in artificial neural networks, which enable machines to make decisions. \n",

    "Q2- What is supervised learning ? List some examples of   supervised learning?\n",
    "Supervised learning is the types of machine learning in which machines are trained using well \"labelled\" training data, and on basis of that data, machines predict the output. The labelled data means some input data is already tagged with the correct output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3- What is unsupervised learning ? List some examples of   unsupervised learning?\n",
    "Unsupervised learning is another machine learning method in which patterns inferred from the unlabeled input data. The goal of unsupervised learning is to find the structure and patterns from the input data. Unsupervised learning does not need any supervision. Instead, it finds patterns from the data by its own.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the unsupervised learning, we will use the example given above. So unlike supervised learning, here we will not provide any supervision to the model. We will just provide the input dataset to the model and allow the model to find the patterns from the data. With the help of a suitable algorithm, the model will train itself and divide the fruits into different groups according to the most similar features between them.\n",

    "Some common types of problems built on top of classification and regression include recommendation and time series prediction respectively.\n",

    "Some popular examples of supervised machine learning algorithms are:\n",

    "Unsupervised Machine Learning\n",
    "Unsupervised learning is where you only have input data (X) and no corresponding output variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal for unsupervised learning is to model the underlying structure or distribution in the data in order to learn more about the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are called unsupervised learning because unlike supervised learning above there is no correct answers and there is no teacher. Algorithms are left to their own devises to discover and present the interesting structure in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised learning problems can be further grouped into clustering and association problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering: A clustering problem is where you want to discover the inherent groupings in the data, such as grouping customers by purchasing behavior.\n",
    "Association:  An association rule learning problem is where you want to discover rules that describe large portions of your data, such as people that buy X also tend to buy Y.\n",
