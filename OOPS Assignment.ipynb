    "Q1. Explain Class and Object with respect to Object-Oriented Programming. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "Ans:-Object-oriented Programming (OOPs) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes in programming.\n",
    "A class is a collection of objects. A class contains the blueprints or the prototype from which the objects are being created. \n",
    "It is a logical entity that contains some attributes and methods. \n",
    "The object is an entity that has a state and behavior associated with it. \n",
    "It may be any real-world object like a mouse, keyboard, chair, table, pen, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Name the four pillars of OOPs.\n",
    "Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation and Abstraction\n",
    "Q3. Explain why the __init__() function is used. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "The __init__ method is similar to constructors in C++ and Java. It is run as soon as an object of a class is instantiated. \n",
    "The method is useful to do any initialization you want to do with your object. \n",
    "class pw1():\n",
    "    def __init__(self,phone_number,email_id,student_id):\n",
    "        self.phone_number=phone_number\n",
    "        self.email_id=email_id\n",
    "        self.student_id=student_id\n",
    "    def return_student(self):\n",
    "        return self.student_id,self.phone_number,self.email_id\n",

    "print(rohan.return_student())\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Why self is used in OOPs?\n",
    "self represents the instance of the class. By using the “self”  we can access the attributes and methods of the class in python.\n",
    "It binds the attributes with the given arguments.\n",
    "Q5. What is inheritance? Give an example for each type of inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parent class is the class being inherited from, also called base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Child class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class.\n",
    "Single inheritance: When a child class inherits from only one parent class, it is called single inheritance.\n",
    "We saw an example above.\n",
    "Multiple inheritances: When a child class inherits from multiple parent classes, it is called multiple inheritances. \n",
